This repository contains my Data Science Internship Assessment  
The project focuses on analyzing how **trader behavior (profitability, risk, leverage, win rates)** aligns or diverges from the **Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index (market sentiment)
Through data preprocessing, EDA, statistical analysis, and visualization, I derived insights that reveal how different sentiment phases (Fear, Greed, Extreme Greed) impact trading outcomes.  

## Key Steps in the Notebook
1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (if required)
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
   - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc.)
5. Statistical Analysis & Sentiment Alignment
6. Insights & Recommendations


## Results & Insights



### Key Findings:
- Most profitable sentiment: Greed ($166.54 avg PnL)  
- Least profitable sentiment:Extreme Greed ($40.06 avg PnL)  
- Highest win rate: Fear (86.0% win rate)  
- Correlation between FGI value and PnL: 0.011 (very weak → almost no direct relationship)  

### Trading Recommendations:
1. Consider increasing trading activity during Greed periods.  
2. Market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) shows weak direct correlation with individual trade outcomes.  
   → Other factors may be more important for trade success.
